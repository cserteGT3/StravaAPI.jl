```julia
using OpenAPI.Clients: Client, set_header
client = Client("https://www.strava.com/api/v3")
set_header(client, "Authorization", "Bearer $access_token")
api = StravaAPI.AthletesApi(client)
athlete, api_resp = get_logged_in_athlete(api)
```

## Documentation

* Julia code docstrings: [Julia docstrings](@ref)
* OpenAPI generated Readme (ignore the installation instructions): [Julia API client for StravaAPI](@ref)
* OpenAPI generated API documentation: below the **API** section

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

### Editing the source code

As the source code is generated by OpenAPI.jl, which overwrites the `src` and `docs` folders.
Therefore every change needs to happen in the [generator](https://github.com/cserteGT3/StravaAPI.jl/tree/main/generator) folder.
It is especially true for the documentation (file names start with `docs.*`).
To generate the package code start docker, then run the following in the project root:

```bash
julia --project=generator generator/generate.jl
```
